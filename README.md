# [Advent of Code 2018](adventofcode.com) (`Potential for Regret` Edition)

I expect very little of myself with this. Frankly, I'm amazed that I'm even trying, especially since I tend to be pretty bad at tackling these types of problems. But alas, here it is - a repository for my feeble (and most likely inferior) solutions.

I'm hoping to use a few different languages and my (imprecise) decision process is as follows:

- Dart - For the really easy ones
- Go - For when I'm feeling adventurous
- JavaScript - The ol' reliable
- Nim - See Dart
- Python - The OG ol' reliable
- Rust - If I have a lot of time on my hands

Happy holidays üéÅ (there's nothing in this box)
